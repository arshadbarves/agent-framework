## 🔧 **Key Components Implemented**

### **1. Command System** (`src/graph/command.rs`)
```rust
// Complete LangGraph-style command routing
pub enum Command {
    Continue,
    Goto { node: String, update: HashMap<String, Value> },
    End { update: HashMap<String, Value> },
    Conditional { condition: String, if_true: String, if_false: String },
    Parallel { nodes: Vec<String>, update: HashMap<String, Value> },
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Agent Nodes** (`src/graph/agent_node.rs`)
```rust
// Agent nodes with command-based routing
impl AgentNode {
    async fn invoke_with_command(&self, state: &mut S, context: &CommandContext) -> GraphResult<Command> {
        let response = self.agent.execute_task(task).await?;
        let command = self.command_parser.parse_command(&response)?;
        context.validate_command(&command)?;
        Ok(command)
    }
}
```

### **3. Tool Integration** (`src/graph/tool_node.rs`)
```rust
// Seamless tool integration in workflows
pub struct ToolNode {
    tool_name: String,
    tool_executor: Arc<ToolExecutor>,
    input_mapping: HashMap<String, String>,
    output_mapping: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

### **4. Dynamic Routing** (`src/graph/routing_node.rs`)
```rust
// Multi-agent coordination with handoffs
pub struct RoutingAgentNode {
    agent: Arc<Mutex<Agent>>,
    routing_rules: HashMap<String, String>,
    command_parser: CommandParser,
}
```
