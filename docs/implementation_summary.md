## 🏆 Key Achievements

### **Core LangGraph Parity** ✅
```rust
// AgentGraph now supports LangGraph-style workflows
let workflow = AgentWorkflow::new()
    .add_node(research_agent_node)
    .add_node(writing_agent_node)
    .add_node(review_agent_node)
    .add_node(quality_gate);

// Execute with state management (like LangGraph's graph.invoke())
workflow.execute(&mut state).await?;
```

### **Agent Integration** ✅
```rust
// AI agents as workflow nodes (like LangGraph's agent nodes)
let agent_node = AgentNode::new(
    ai_agent,
    "Process this input: {input}".to_string(),
    "processing".to_string(),
    "output".to_string(),
);
```

### **State Management** ✅
```rust
// Typed state objects (like LangGraph's TypedDict)
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct WorkflowState {
    pub input: String,
    pub output: String,
    pub stage: String,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

## 📊 Performance Results
